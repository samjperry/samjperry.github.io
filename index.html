	    <h2>Bio:</h2>
	    I'm Sam, the owner of this website. 
	    I am currently a first year student at the University of Vermont,
        where I study Mechanical Engineering. A friend of mine inspired 
        me to get a website, so now I am exploring the world of web development.

	    <h2>More:</h2>
	    This is a side project (get it? this is on the other side) that I'm
	    working on to hopefully gain a better understanding of how the internet
	    works and what I can do to contribute to it.
