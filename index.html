	    <h2>Bio:</h2>
	    I'm Sam, the owner of this website. 
	    I am currently a second year student at the University of Vermont,
        where I study Mechanical Engineering. A friend of mine inspired 
        me to get a website, so now I am exploring the world of web development.

	    <h2>More:</h2>
	    This site is intended as a side project to host some accomplishments
		  that I have as a student at UVM and as an Engineer. I intend to
		  add multiple pages with more content with a top bar to navigate
		  through the site.
